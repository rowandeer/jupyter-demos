    "You can see a new keyword: `def`. `def` tells Python you are about to **define** a **function**. Like variables, you are free to name functions whatever you like - as long as you don't name them the same as an already **reserved word** (like `print` or `if`). Also, just like variables, functions can't have spaces or special characters (besides underscores `_`). It's common practice to keep function names lowercase and use underscores `_` to create names of multiple words. Additionally, it's always a good idea to choose a function name that describes exactly what the function does.\n",

    "The parentheses `()` after the function name are very important. They serve a purpose we'll talk about in the section below. For now, we keep them empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with `if` statements, function definitions start a **code block** with a colon `:`. All indented lines of code that follow are considered **code inside the function**. The first line that's not indented signals to Python that the code block has ended. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, there are two lines **inside** the function. The final `print()` statement is no longer indented and, therefore, not part of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very important to understand that no matter where in the code a function is defined, the code inside the function **is not executed until the function is \"called\"** (you \"call\" a function - which means to execute it - by writing its name together with parentheses `()`, as you see in the last line of the example above). \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a close look at the order of lines from the example above. First, you see \"So how old are you really?\", but that's not the first thing you see when you run the code. The first line that get's printed actually appears in the final `print()` statement of the code - \"Your age can't possibly be ...\". That's because it is only **after** that line is printed that the `ask_for_age()` function is called. \n",

That means don't use functions and just write the code for the second question below the code for the first question. This way, you visualize easily which parts of your code are repeated. In the next step, you can then try to think about how to combine those repeated parts of the code into **functions** with **arguments**. This part of the programming process is called **refactoring** - you change your previously messy code into something that's cleaner and more maintainable (e.g., by using functions). Try thinking about this for a while, but if you get stuck for too long, check the hint below.\n",

You'll learn more about this kind of code later. For now, just know you can use the `random_number_within_range()` function anywhere in your code below. You can define the first and second argument as the lowest and highest number of the range within which the number should be generated. For example, like this: `random_number_within_range(0, 10000)`\n",

Similarly, the `random.randint()` function uses the values `1` and `6` the first time and `1` and `100` the second time. So the code is largely the same. The only difference is the range defined by two numbers. This tells us that with some changes to the code, we can move all of the code into a function with two **arguments** for the two numbers.\n",

    "We replaced the two numbers with two argument names `start_range` and `end_range`. Because those values are **integers** we need to convert them into **strings** if we want to combine them with other strings. We use the `str()` function for that. \n",

It can be very complicated to try and understand all of these concepts at once. But the good news is that these are core elements you'll be using when writing code all the time. So you will be practicing them a lot. And you can start practicing right now with the following exercise: \n",

    "Now, this is another difficult one. It'll require a lot of thinking and using a combination of functions and multiple conditions. But you know all the tools for creating this game. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python file on your computer. \n",
    "2. At the top of the file copy and paste the code to randomly generate a number in Python. You'll need it for the computer's choice: \n",

    "```python\n",
    "# This code will generate a random number:\n",

    "3. Start the game by asking the user for their choice of \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\".\n",
    "4. Let the computer randomly choose among those three options. The easiest way to do that is to generate a random number between 1 and 3 and let each number represent one of the three choices. \n",
    "5. Now, for the complicated part. You will need to use multiple conditions to compare the computer choice and the user choice and determine who won. There are many different ways to solve this task! So don't get stuck trying to find the \"correct\" answer: you just need an answer that _works_. \n",
    "6. Print on the screen whether the player or the computer won. _(Tip: Also print the computer's and player's choice again. This will help you check that the code is working as intended.)_\n",
    "7. Given what you have learned above about **functions** and **refactoring**, let the player repeat the game three times.

For now, just use functions to repeat the game three times.)_"
