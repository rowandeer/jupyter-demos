    "In this lesson, you'll learn one of the most important complex data types of all: dictionaries. You'll learn to represent the data of your application in complex data structures, and to reason about which kinds of data an application needs and how the different data types relate to each other.\n",

    "([Back to top](#Table-of-Contents))\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like a **list**, a **dictionary** is another **complex data type** - which means it represents multiple data points at once (just like a list). In other programming languages, it's also known as a **hash** or **object** (although both those terms can also mean slightly different things, so be careful!), but thankfully Python names things in a more human-understandable way. That's why a list in Python is called a list (and not an \"array\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "So what's a dictionary? Outside of programming, a dictionary is of course a book or online resource that pairs terms with a definition or a translation, like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python: \"a very large snake that kills animals for food by wrapping itself around them and crushing them\"\n",
    "software: \"the instructions that control what a computer does\"\n",
    "jupiter: \"the fifth planet from the Sun, after Mars and before Saturn\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source: Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary in Python does something similar. But while a classic dictionary pairs words and definitions, a Python dictionary pairs what we call **keys** and **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **value** in a dictionary can be any data type: strings, numbers, lists, tuples (or even other dictionaries! ü§Ø).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key** is used to access that value. Each **key** must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a list works when you just need to collect lots of single pieces of information together, dictionaries are useful when you want to connect sets of two pieces of information together: for example names and telephone numbers in a contacts application, or dates and text entries in a journal application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Creating Dictionaries\n",
    "([Back to top](#Table-of-Contents))\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a simple contacts app that lists multiple names and their corresponding phone number. You could try to store the data in a list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contacts = [\n",
    "  \"Jorge 123-456-7890\",\n",
    "  \"Lin 980-765-4321\",\n",
    "  \"Ana 321-654-0987\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But that has multiple downsides. You have the phone number and name both in the same string and would need to find a way to separate them if you want to call someone straight from the app. You may want to display the name and the number in separate places, or edit just one of those pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it makes a lot more sense to create a **dictionary** in this situation. Have a look at this example and run the cell:"

    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a small phonebook application. The user should be able to add multiple contacts to their phonebook. For each contact, they can add a name, phone number, and email address. (Feel free to expand on that idea and add extra fields if you want!) \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python file. \n",
    "2. Your application should have a basic loop to run the program. Start by asking the user to enter the name of a new contact. \n",
    "3. Follow the question by asking for additional fields such as phone number and email address. \n",
    "4. Add a dictionary per contact to a list. Then, ask the user if they'd like to add another new contact and allow them to do so if they answer \"yes.\"\n",
    "5. Once the user is done adding contacts, print the entire list of contacts in a visually appealing way (using a for-loop). Add icons such as üìû or üìß to display the contact details on separate lines. _(You may have to think hard about how to get the individual data points during each iteration of the for-loop. Work with print statements to try getting close to the solution if you get stuck!)_\n",
    "6. Finally, use another loop to ask the user if they want to delete any of the contacts. Allow them to delete items by naming the position (index) of the contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task might take you a bit longer as it combines all aspects of what you have learned so far. But make sure to take the time and complete it. Only through practice will you progress! \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you want an extra challenge, try expanding on the functionality by saving the contact list to a file. This isn't something you have learned yet. But Python has a lot of powerful features that go way beyond the scope of this course! So it's not a bad idea to have a look at Python's official tutorials and documentation. Only once you have completed the task above - and if you are looking for a more advanced task - look at this tutorial and try to apply what you have learned there to store the contact list as a simple .txt file: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#"
