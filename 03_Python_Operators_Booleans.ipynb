    "The notion of `True` and `False` is very important in programming. Most programs do something like this: \"If it's true that the user clicked this button, then submit the form.\" or \"As soon as it's true that the current time is the same as the one the user set in the alarm, then play a loud alarm sound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For a computer to know whether or not a user has clicked a button, or if it's a certain time of day, it makes use of `True` and `False`. Or you may see people use the terms \"truthy\" and \"falsy.\" Those words sound a bit silly. But they refer to things that \"appear true\" or \"appear false\" but aren't of the exact **boolean** data type `True` or `False`. For instance, the number `0` would be considered \"falsy\", whereas `1` or any higher number is considered \"truthy\". Or an empty string `\"\"` is considered falsy, while it's truthy as soon as it has at least one character in it.\n",

    "Logical operators extend comparison operators to allow you to do even more. While many programming languages have logical operators, it's unique to Python that they are in plain English. They are `and`, `or`, and `not`. Based on those words, you might already know what they're used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using logical operators, you can combine multiple checks. For example, you can check if a password is longer than 5 characters **and** shorter than 20 characters. Or you could check if the duration of a movie is within a certain range (e.g., between 40 and 210 minutes).\n",

    "This can be a bit mind-boggling. So don't worry if you have to think about this for a moment. In fact, it's good if you do! As a programmer, you constantly run into situations where you have to think about which approach is more suitable in a given situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the movie length is 180 minutes, the first version will result in `True`. The second will result in `False`. Which one is more suitable will depend on the specific use case of the application. For example, if you want to find all the movies within this range, you'd go for the first option. If you want to filter out movies within that range (and therefore find movies outside of that range), you may want to opt for the second version. \n",
