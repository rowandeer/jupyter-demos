    "In this lesson, you'll learn about repeating the execution of code over and over again using loops. You will learn to combine the various concepts of loops, conditions, and functions to write software that \"stays open\" and does not shut down after executing a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎢 Loops\n",
    "([Back to top](#Table-of-Contents))\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you ever wonder how software just \"keeps running\" or \"stays on\" until you actively close a window or turn it off?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all programs you created do one thing and stop running as soon as the operation is done. For example, the temperature conversion tool stops running after the conversion is done. It shuts down immediately and if you want to run another conversion you have to start it again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a web browser was to just shut down the moment you entered the URL and opened a website and you had to reopen it every time you wanted to open a new page. \"Here is the website. All done now. Goodbye.\" That would be incredibly useless and annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most software continues to run after an operation has been completed. It lets users repeat an action or do something else. Usually, it keeps running infinitely until the user actively tells the software to stop by closing the window or shutting it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what **loops** are used for - another **control flow** element of most programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, code executes line by line from top to bottom. When it reaches the end it stops. However, with a loop, you can define code to run repeatedly. You can define exactly how often it should be repeated or if it should repeat forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 While Loops\n",
    "([Back to top](#Table-of-Contents))\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple different types of loops. In this lesson, we'll look at **while loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop repeats the code inside it for as long as (or \"while\") a particular condition is `True`.\n",

    "\n",
    ">🔥 If, after your changes, this window seems to freeze or runs forever, don't worry! When working with loops you have to be a bit more careful. If you misconfigure a loop it could run forever and, in extreme cases, crash the software or even the computer. If that happens just reload the window or restart the Jupyter Notebook (or restart the Kernel: in the `Kernel` menu at the top of the screen, click `Restart Kernel`) and don't worry. These things happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` keyword starts a `while` loop. Similar to `if`-statements, it's followed with a condition. As long as the condition is evaluated to \"True\", the loop will keep running. Once the condition is \"False,\" the loop will stop running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with conditions and functions, the colon `:` signals to Python that a **code block** is starting. That means all the code that's indented on the lines below will be considered _inside_ the `while` loop. The first line that's not indented anymore will signal the end of the code block. (In this case, it's the `print(\"🎉 Tada!\")` line.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`time.sleep()` is a built-in function that comes with Python, which, as you have seen above, introduces a delay in the running of the program, the length of which is defined in seconds in the argument. So `time.sleep(3)` will introduce a 3-second delay before the program continues running. (You need `import time` to get access to this function, but don't worry about understanding exactly what that does for now: just think of it as allowing a Python program to measure time.) \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 You can of course use basic math operations to control the number of times that a while-loop runs without the time.sleep() function. For example:"

The code below is a simple implementation of that kind of logic, using an if-else condition. Run the code and submit a password that's shorter than three characters. You'll notice the program asks the user to enter a longer password but then stops. It would be better if the user could immediately try again to enter a new password.

    "First the computer-generated number: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by creating a new function called `generate_random_number`. The function should `return` a random number between `1` and `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a function for the user to choose a number. It'll include some extra logic to avoid false inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create another function called `get_user_number`. \n",
    "- Inside that function, ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 and store the user's input in a variable (e.g., you could call it `user_number`)\n",
    "- Still inside that function, check if `user_number` really is a number. Only if it is, `return` it as an `integer`. (**💡 Remember: if a `while` loop is inside a function, the `return` keyword will have the same effect as `break`!)**\n",
    "- If it's not a number the user should be asked again to guess a number between 1 and 10. \n",
    "- Bonus: Add yet another check to see if the number is in fact greater than 1 and less than 10. If it's not, also, repeat the question and ask the user to input a number again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have two pieces of isolated code that can be called and executed individually. Now, we need some initial code that is executed only once as the game starts. Make sure to write the following code outside of any functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Display a short message welcoming the user to the game. \n",
    "- Call the `generate_random_number` function and assign it to a global variable (e.g., `computer_number`). We do this once in the beginning because it shouldn't change while the player is guessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we get to the **game loop**. This is the interaction the player will repeat over and over until they guess the computer's number correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new infinite loop. The following code will all go inside that.\n",
    "- Call `get_user_number` and assign it to a variable (e.g., `user_number`).\n",
    "- If the two numbers are equal, congratulate the user on winning and stop the loop.\n",
    "- If the user's number is larger than the random number, display \"Too high!\" **and** continue the loop. \n",
    "- If the user's number is smaller, display \"Too low!\" **and** continue the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! That's the entire game. Try it out and see if you run into any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    ">🔥 It's very likely that you will run into an error when working on this. For example, you might come across a **TypeError**. Read the error carefully and try to figure out how you could solve the issue. If you get stuck for too long, try the hints below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus**: If you want, try adding a counter variable. The count should start at 0. Whenever the user is re-prompted to enter a new guess, the counter should be increased by one. In the end, display how many attempts the user needed to complete the game.\n",

    "If you completed the rock-paper-scissors game in the previous lesson, you can take what you have learned here to improve on it. Use a `while`-loop to allow the user to repeatedly play the game after completing it (you could allow the user to keep playing **while** they answer yes, or **while** a pre-specified number of rounds has not yet been reached). \n",
    "\n",

    "Add some validation to make sure the user only inputs what they are supposed to input. For example, if the user should type in `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`, you could use a loop to re-prompt them to enter their answer again if they enter anything other than those three words. \n",
