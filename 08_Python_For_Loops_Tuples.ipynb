    "Today we're going to learn about another type of loop. You already learned about the `while` loop. The `for` loop is another way to repeat code multiple times. But instead of looping code based on a condition, it repeats code based on items in a sequence (such as items in a list, or characters in a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop allows you to go through all the items in a list and execute code for each member of the list - known as \"iteration\" in programming. This is used in a large number of applications. In web applications or mobile apps `for`-loops are used all the time to make lists more visually appealing and add visual elements such as bullet points, line breaks, or checkboxes to each of the list items. Run the code below to see an example:"

    "\n",
    "All you need to remember is that `enumerate()` is useful when using `for`-loops, because it gives you access to an item's index during each iteration. Since you're then working with two elements (the item index and the item value), you then need to define two variables in the `for`-loop. Again, you can name those two variables whatever you want. But to keep the code understandable it makes sense to just call the first one `index` (or `i` for short) and the second one a meaningful name for the individual list items."

    "In this exercise, you can reuse what you worked on in the previous lesson when building a **to-do list application**. (If you haven't done that task yet, now is a good time to catch up!)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, create a simple to-do list application (in its own Python file) with the following main features:\n",
    "  - The user can choose whether to add an item, remove an item (by its index), or exit the application.\n",
    "  - The user may perform any of the first two actions multiple times without exiting the program. \n",
    "  - Errors are handled gracefully, so that the application doesn't crash if the user, e.g., enters an index that's not in the list or enters something other than \"add\", \"remove\", or \"exit\".\n",
    "2. New: Add a third option to the application. Let the user also choose to \"show\" the current list of tasks (and remember to add \"show\" to your error case line!)\n",
    "3. When the user chooses to \"show\" the list, print each individual list item on its own line on the screen. At the start of each line write the **index** followed by a dot before displaying the actual task. It should end up looking like a numbered list (like the one you're reading right now).\n",
    "4. While computers start counting at 0, humans don't tend to do that. Add `1` to each of the displayed indexes in the loop. And when the user enters a number to remove something from the list, let them enter the displayed number and **not** the index. You'll need to do some simple math operations in a couple of places to achieve this. \n",
    "5. If you like, you can turn the last step into a function (`show_list()`, for example) and then call this function instead of the print statements you used after adding or remove items."
